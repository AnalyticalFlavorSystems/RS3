To install libs3 on a POSIX system (except Microsoft Windows):
--------------------------------------------------------------

Note that all POSIX builds have prerequisites, such as development libraries
that libs3 requires and that must be installed at the time that libs3 is
built.  The easiest way to find out what those are, is to run the build
command and then observe the results.

*** For RPM-based systems (Fedora Core, Mandrake, etc) ***

* rpmbuild -ta <libs3 archive>

for example:

rpmbuild -ta libs3-0.3.tar.gz


*** For dpkg-based systems (Debian, Ubuntu, etc) ***

* make deb

This will produce a Debian package in the build/pkg directory.


*** For all other systems ***

* make [DESTDIR=destination root] install

DESTDIR defaults to /usr


To install libs3 on a Microsoft Windows system:
-----------------------------------------------

*** Using MingW ***

* libs3 can be built on Windows using the MingW compiler.  No other tool
  is needed.  However, the following libraries are needed to build libs3:

  - curl development libraries
  - libxml2 development libraries, and the libraries that it requires:
    - iconv
    - zlib

  These projects are independent of libs3, and their release schedule and
  means of distribution would make it very difficult to provide links to
  the files to download and keep them up-to-date in this file, so no attempt
  is made here.

  Development libraries and other files can be placed in:
  c:\libs3-libs\bin
  c:\libs3-libs\include

  If the above locations are used, then the GNUmakefile.mingw will work with
  no special caveats.  If the above locations are not used, then the following
  environment variables should be set:
  CURL_LIBS should be set to the MingW compiler flags needed to locate and
      link in the curl libraries
  CURL_CFLAGS should be set to the MingW compiler flags needed to locate and
      include the curl headers
  LIBXML2_LIBS should be set to the MingW compiler flags needed to locate and
      link in the libxml2 libraries
  LIBXML2_CFLAGS should be set to the MingW compiler flags needed to locate and
      include the libxml2 headers

* mingw32-make [DESTDIR=destination] -f GNUmakefile.mingw install

DESTDIR defaults to libs3-<version>

* DESTDIR can be zipped up into a .zip file for distribution.  For best
  results, the dependent libraries (curl, openssl, etc) should be included,
  along with their licenses.
