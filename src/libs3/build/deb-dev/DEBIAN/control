Description: C Development Library for Amazon S3 Access
 This library provides an API for using Amazon's S3 service (see
 http://s3.amazonaws.com).  Its design goals are:
 .
  - To provide a simple and straightforward API for accessing all of S3's
    functionality
  - To not require the developer using libs3 to need to know anything about:
      - HTTP
      - XML
      - SSL
    In other words, this API is meant to stand on its own, without requiring
    any implicit knowledge of how S3 services are accessed using HTTP
    protocols.
  - To be usable from multithreaded code
  - To be usable by code which wants to process multiple S3 requests
    simultaneously from a single thread
  - To be usable in the simple, straightforward way using sequentialized
    blocking requests
